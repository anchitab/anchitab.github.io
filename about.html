                    <p1> I'm an aspiring software engineer/product manager studying computer science in sunny southern California. I'm currently an undergraduate student at UC Riverside's, Marlan and Rosemary Bourns College of Engineering, and am a first-year CS student.
										<br>
										<br>
										<p1> Let's talk tech. In high school, I played around with <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and some MongoDB and built a website for Stanford's Pre-Collegiate Program's Counselors to help communicate with students efficiently. In college, I dove into object-oriented programming and have created projects in labs including a Bulletin Board and Archer Game with <strong>C++</strong>.
											 I am currently expanding my programming toolbox and am learning Python, Matlab, and SQL.
										<br>
										<br>
										<p1> I'm passionate about <strong>diversity in tech</strong>, especially women empowerment in this field. It simply doesn't make sense that females make up more than half of the consumers of tech products yet are barely a fraction of the teams making them. I am glad to be a part of such welcmong communties like Rewriting the Code and WinC. Furthermore, I
											believe that everyone should have equal access to computer programmng which is why I helped create curriculum for the Youth Competitve Programming Circle.
										<br>
										<br>
										<p1> In my free time, you can find me at my local spin studio, eating good food, or traveling!
